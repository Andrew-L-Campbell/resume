                        <p>For this project I was given a short story text file that I had to 
                            count how many of each letters and numbers that appeared. Then I 
                            had to display them in order, preorder and in post order. This 
                            project helped me learn and understand these algorithms.

                        <h2>Sprinkler Zone Controller</h2>
                        <p>For this project I designed an Arduino program to be able to turn on
                            and off a valve to control a new sprinkler zone for my yard. I first
                            designed the microcontroller with a screen and buttons. I then had 
                            it display time, set sprinkler start time, set a way to turn on and 
                            off sprinkler by pressing a button, and a way to get to the home 
                            screen from wherever you are at in the program.

                            that are comprised of the picked word.
